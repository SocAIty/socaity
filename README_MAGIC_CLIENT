# Magic Client by SocAIty.ai

Ever wanted to use web APIs as if they are any other python function?
It was never easier to build an SDK for your hosted services, than it is with the magic client.

Out of the box works with following services:
- OpenAPI 3.0 / RestAPIs
- Socaity Routers



# Get started

To integrate an webservice you need to follow two steps:
1. Instantiate a service client with the base url of the service and the endpoint routes.
2. Use the SDK maker with the service


```python
from magic_client import MagicClient
