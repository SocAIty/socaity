The SDK provides generative models and AI tools across all domains including text, audio, image and more. 
Our APIs and SDK allows you to run models as simple python functions. No GPU or AI knowledge required.
Build your dream application by composing different models together.

If you are a Software Engineer, Game Developer, Artist, Content Creator and you want to automate with AI this SDK is for you.

For an overview of all models and to obtain an API key visit [socaity.ai](https://www.socaity.ai)

Run models as if they were python functions nomatter where they are deployed:
- hosted on socaity servers (default)
- deployed on your localhost / your own server- hybrid deployment

You can focus on your app, while we handle all the complicated stuff under the hood.

# Getting started

## Installation
Install the package from PyPi
```python
pip install socaity
```

## Authentication

For using socaity.ai services you need to set the environment variable `SOCAITY_API_KEY`.
You can obtain an API key from [socaity.ai](https://www.socaity.ai) after signing up.
Now you are ready to use the SDK.

**Alternatively** you can set the API key in your code when using the SDK. 
We don't recommend this, as it a common mistake to push your code including your API key to a public repository.
```python
from socaity import FluxSchnell
flux_schnell = FluxSchnell(service="socaity", api_key="sai..your_api_key")
```

If you **instead** want to directly communicate with your runpod services or replicate you can set 
the environment variable `RUNPOD_API_KEY` or `REPLICATE_API_KEY`.
When initializing your ModelClient you can additionally pass which provider you want to use by using "service" parameter.

# Quick start

Import a model from the model-zoo or just use the simple API (text2img, text2speech etc.)
```python
from socaity import FluxSchnell, text2speech, text2img
```
Then you can use it as a function
```python
flux_schnell = FluxSchnell().text2img("A beautiful sunset in the mountains")
my_image = text2img("A beautiful sunset in the mountains").get_result()
```

### Example 1: Combine llm, text2img and text2speech

We will use different models to showcase how to create for example a perfect combination for a blog.
```python
from socaity import DeepSeekR1, text2voice, text2img

deepseek = DeepSeekR1()
poem = deepseek.chat("Write a poem with 3 sentences why a SDK is so much better than plain web requests.").get_result()
poem = deepseek.pretty(poem)

audio = text2voice(poem, model="speechcraft", voice="hermine")

my_image_prompt = """
A robot enjoying a stunning sunset in the alps. In the clouds is written in big letters "SOCAITY SDK".
The sky is lit with deep purple and lime colors. It is a wide-shot.
The artwork is striking and cinematic, showcasing a vibrant neon-green lime palette, rendered in an anime-style illustration with 4k detail. 
Influenced by the artistic styles of Simon Kenny, Giorgetto Giugiaro, Brian Stelfreeze, and Laura Iverson.
"""

image = text2img(text=my_image_prompt, model="flux-schnell", num_outputs=1)
audio.get_result().save("sdk_poem.mp3")
image.get_result().save("sdk_poem.png")
```
This results in something like this:


### Jobs vs. Results

When you invoke an service, internally we use threading and asyncio to check the socaity endpoints for the result.
This makes it possible to run multiple services in parallel and is very efficient.
```python
# the base method always returns a job
d_job = deepseek.chat("Write a poem with 3 sentences why a SDK is so much better than plain web requests.")
# in the meantime you can call other services or do what you want
... do other things here ... 
# when you need the result you can call get_result()
poem = d_job.get_result()
```
To simplify even more you can use the helper functions with the argument `await_result=True` then the function will block until the result is available.
```python
from socaity import chat 
poem = chat("Write a poem with 3 sentences why a SDK is so much better than plain web requests.", await_result=True)
```

# Model zoo

A curated list of hosted models you always find on [socaity.ai](https://www.socaity.ai).

To start here's a list of some of the models you can use with the SDK.
Just import them with ```from socaity import ...``` to use them.

### Text domain
- DeepSeek-R1
- LLama3 Family (8b, 13b, 70b models. Codellama and Instruct models)

### Image domain
- FluxSchnell (Text2Image)
- SAM2 (Image and video segmentation)
- TencentArc Photomaker

### Audio domain
- [SpeechCraft](https://github.com/SocAIty/SpeechCraft) (Text2Voice, VoiceCloning)


Note that we have just launched the startup. Expect new models coming highly frequently.


# Working locally or with other providers

Any service that is [fastSDK](https://github.com/SocAIty/fastsdk) compatible  (openAPI / [fastTaskAPI](https://github.com/SocAIty/FastTaskAPI), replicate and [runpod](https://www.runpod.io/)) 
can be used with this package.

Model deployment type    | Description                                                    | Pros                                           | Cons
-------------            |----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------| ------------
Locally         | Install genAI packages on your machine and use it with socaity | Free, Open-Source                              | GPU needed, more effort
Hosted  | Use the AIs hosted on socaity servers or of another provider.  | Runs everywhere, Ultra-easy, always up to date | Slightly higher cost
Hybrid | Deploy on runpod, locally and use socaity services.            | Full flexibility                               | Effort


### Example: deploying and using an service locally 

This example demonstrates the use case with [face2face](https://github.com/SocAIty/face2face).
With face2face you can swap faces, restore images and detect faces in images.
```bash
# Install the package
pip install face2face
# Start the server on localhost 
python -m face2face.server
```
Now you can use the SDK with the service parameter set to "localhost"
```python
from socaity import Face2Face
f2f = Face2Face(service="localhost")
f2f.swap_img_to_img("path/to/image1.jpg", "path/to/image2.jpg")
```

Socaity publishes services open-source. So you can use any of them in a similar way.

Furthermore: any service that is created with [FastTaskAPI](https://github.com/SocAIty/FastTaskAPI) can be easily used in combination with [FastSDK](https://github.com/SocaIty/fastsdk).
Checkout the [FastSDK](https://github.com/SocaIty/fastsdk) documentation for more information.

### Example: using a service hosted on runpod

We assume the service is already hosted. FastTaskAPI makes it incredibly easy to deploy services.
Checkout the [FastTaskAPI](https://github.com/SocAIty/FastTaskAPI) documentation to learn how to host on runpod.
```python
# setup adresses
from socaity.api.image.img2img.face2face.face2face_service_client import srvc_face2face
srvc_face2face.add_service_url("my_runpod", "https://api.runpod.ai/v2/your_runpod_service_id")
# use the service
f2f = Face2Face(service="my_runpod", api_key="your_api_key")
f2f.swap_img_to_img("path/to/image1.jpg", "path/to/image2.jpg")
```
